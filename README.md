# Panama Paradise: Discovery of corruption

# Abstract
The Panama Papers are an unprecedented leak of 11.5 million documents from the database of the worldâ€™s fourth biggest offshore law firm, Mossack Fonseca. It presents financial and attorney-client information for more than 214,488 offshore entities. The idea of the project is to understand how these offshore entities function, what is the legal side and what is the illegal side of each investment, specifically the correlation with corruption. Secondly, analyze how are specific individuals, companies and countries involved and to which extent, We will further comprehend the relationship, if any, between economic and sociopolitical conditions of a given country with corruption and illegal activities. By means of graphical representation and data analysis, the project can help people to have a better understanding on how these offshore entities operate and may make people more aware about the hidden face of money laundering, taxes evasion, corruption and the harm that can cause to this world.

# Dataset
The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) database we are going to work on is the Panama papers which were part of the Paradise Papers investigations.
The ICIJ shared the panama papers dataset in 4 languages. It was first made of NET files (made of nodes and relationships between the nodes). To make the dataset accessible to everyone ICIJ converted the original dataset into several CSV files, one per type of node and one for all the relationships for each project. The data size is 352 Mb and may be downloaded in a zip file from the offshore leak database website (https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/pages/database).

In order to enrich and find more we can use http://data.ontotext.com/linkedleaks, which provides additional knowledge by linking the Panama Papers to information about countries and geographical regions.
