Panama Paradise: Analysis of Tax Heaven by Country

The Panama Papers are an unprecedented leak of 11.5 million documents from the database of the worldâ€™s fourth-biggest offshore law firm, Mossack Fonseca. It presents financial and attorney-client information for more than 214,488 offshore entities. The documents contain personal financial information about wealthy individuals and public officials that had previously been kept private. While offshore business entities are legal (see Offshore Magic Circle), reporters found that some of the Mossack Fonseca shell corporations were used for illegal purposes, including fraud, tax evasion, and evading international sanctions according to ICIJ reporters, for example:

In Uruguay, 5 people have been arrested and charged with money-laundering through the Mossack Fonseca by setting up shell companies for a Mexican drug cartel. It has also been reported by Ouestaf, an ICIJ partner, that Karim Wade a Senegalese politician received payments from DP World. Karim and a friend of his were convicted of this. 

In the leak, there were also present more than 140 international power players like former world leaders,  politicians, celebrities, businessmen and other wealthy families and individuals. The dataset comprises data coming from over 200 countries. 

Having an offshore company is actually legal, so whoever is reading this should not conclude that these power players are actually corrupt. In fact, what we discovered that having only this dataset, we are able only to do statistical analysis rather than discovering corruption which was our initial goal.
