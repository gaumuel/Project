### Exploratory Analysis

Panama papers, as most of the offshore datasets that are found online, contains 5 types of roles:
1. Entity: An Entity is an offshore company that has been created in a low-tax place. 
2. Officer: An Officer is somebody or something that has some roll in the offshore entity. Most of the times an officer is a person, though it can also be a company or a foundation. 
3. Intermediary: An Intermediary is usually serving as a middleman for somebody that wants to open an offshore company or to find an offshore service provider. 
4. Address: An Address which serves as the contact postal address of the offshore entity.
5. Edges which represent the relationships between entities, officers, intermediaries, and addresses.

Next, we start by finding out some information about the countries involved, namely which are the countries most mentioned in the papers and which are the most used
jurisdiction for the companies. In the following plot we visualize our findings.

We see that Switzerland and Hong Kong are the most involved countries per number of entities, which is expected given the importance of the swiss bank secrecy before the financial crisis. 
The amount of entities increases steadily from the 90s to 2010, where it starts to decrease most probably because of stricter measure against tax evasion by different jurisdiction, especially G20 countries.
