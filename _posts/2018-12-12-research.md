### Questions?

Given the amount of information and the sensible topic, we can ask some interesting questions:

* The story of panama: How and when it became a fiscal paradise? What are the most implicated countries ? Is there a common point between them?

* How does the correlation between a country economic/sociopolitical conditions change? Can we find higher correlation between undeveloped country?

* How did the economical situation of the fiscal paradise change over the years? 

We focus primarly on the correlation between the number of entities mentioned in the documents belonging to a country and its economical/social condition based on different economical and financial indeces.

For the analysis we are not using the full dataset but a graph based version provided by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) which shared the panama papers dataset in 4 languages. It was first made of NET files (made of nodes and relationships between the nodes). To make the dataset accessible to everyone ICIJ converted the original dataset into several CSV files, one per type of node and one for all the relationships for each project. The data size is 352 Mb and may be downloaded in a zip file from the offshore leak database website [dataset](https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/pages/database).
