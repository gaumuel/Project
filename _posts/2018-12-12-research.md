Given the amount of information and the sensible topic, we can ask some interesting questions:

* The story of panama: How and when it became a fiscal paradise? What are the most implicated countries ? Is there a common point between them?

* How does the correlation between a country economic/sociopolitical conditions change? Can we find higher correlation between undeveloped country?

* How did the economical situation of the fiscal paradise change over the years? 

We focus primarly on the correlation between the number of entities mentioned in the documents belonging to a country and its economical/social condition based on different indeces.
